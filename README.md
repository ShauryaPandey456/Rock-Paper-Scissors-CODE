# Rock-Paper-Scissors-CODE C#
This the code for the ROCK PAPER SCISSORS project I am making it is not finished but should be finished within 3 to 4 days. 
Many things are not finished but do not worry about that because it will be finished over time. 
Some code I wrote like the last 4 lines of code at the bottom of the github page are lines of code that are work in progress so do not panic if the computer prints it out and some things do not make sense to you. This project was also complied in c# programming language.
