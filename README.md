# Rock-Paper-Scissors-CODE C#
This is the code I wrote for beginner's in c# for rock, paper, scissors. It took a few days because I am lazy but overall it is pretty good does the basic stuff of rock paper scissors, and there is no additions it's the actually game with no add ons by me. If you would like you canuse this code for your self when making projects I just want to advise you that do not use this to copy and paste use this as a reference for your code!
Thanks!
